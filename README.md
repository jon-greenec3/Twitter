## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
1. I had a hard time getting the app to function with the year old video. I only found out about the google docs that fixed the video untill it was too late.
2. I had a hard time with the errors that would pop up on my screen periodically for lots of things I entered in like the walkthrough showed me. I eventually fixed most of them
