## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
1. I had a hard time getting the app to sign me in and load the my feed. Because I did not have a twitter before this assignment, the app did not load any tweets and had very little for my profile.
2. Also my LiceCap was not working properly for some reason.
